**OVERVIEW**

In this application, we will explore a dataset from Kaggle. The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing.  Our goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive.  As a result of our analysis, we have provided clear recommendations to our client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car.

**Results**

We have completed our initial analysis to identify key factors influencing used car prices. Our findings confirm that vehicle age and mileage are the strongest predictors, with newer cars commanding higher prices and higher mileage leading to lower resale values. Interestingly, our model also found a non-linear depreciation trend, where price drops at a slower rate as cars age.

Beyond these factors, vehicle characteristics also impact pricing. Diesel vehicles tend to be priced higher, likely due to their fuel efficiency and durability. Pickup trucks retain value better than other body types, while front-wheel drive vehicles are priced lower, possibly due to consumer preferences for other drivetrains.

Our model successfully captures major pricing trends, but there is room for further refinement. Including factors like brand reputation, regional demand, and vehicle condition could enhance accuracy. Additionally, testing alternative models could provide deeper insights into pricing patterns.
